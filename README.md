Here we can see Urban cities excel in all categories, except for average fare per ride and average fare per driver. 

![Total Fare](https://github.com/alecngai/05_Pybar_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png)

Here is a time analysis of the fares per cities, we can see it is consistant between the months that Urban city has the biggest market share. 

## Summary

From our data we can see that there are much more drivers in Urban envorniment than rural, it would be advised to reduce tthe amount of drivers in Urban and increase the rural, this would allow a more earnable wage for the drivers, as the current fare per driver in Urban is $16.57,  which is a decent wage, however, it does not take into account, gas, car maintenece, etc.
